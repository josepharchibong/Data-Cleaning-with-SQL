## About this Project
<p align="left">
  In the world of data analysis, the process of cleaning raw data is often likened to the initial stages of sculpting a masterpiece. Without careful attention to detail and precision,     the final analysis risks being ruined by inaccuracies and inconsistencies. One of the most powerful tools for this crucial task is SQL (Structured Query Language)
<br />
<br />
    This project aims to showcase the power of SQL in cleaning and preparing real-world datasets for analysis. I'll be utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains survey responses from 126 college students regarding their food choices and preferences. However, like many real-world datasets, it's filled with errors and inconsistencies. Using SQL, we'll tackle common data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
